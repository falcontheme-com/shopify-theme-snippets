# Shopify Snippets
Shopify Theme Snippets that you may use in the Dawn theme or any other Shopify theme. 

Contrary to other snippet codes, the most important feature is that you don't have to edit or modify any theme files in the process, making your life easier when needing to update your theme. 

All you have to do to install our snippets is to copy and paste the code found mostly in one file. Also, we provide detailed information, an installation guide, and a complimentary video (YouTube) for each snippet.
